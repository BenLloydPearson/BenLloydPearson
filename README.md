# Welcome

My name is Ben Lloyd Pearson, I'm an expert in Developer Relations, Advocacy, and Marketing with 10 years of experience. 

I work on gitStream - a workflow automation tool for the code review process, and I love finding unique and creative ways to solve development challenges.

gitStream enables you to use YAML configuration files to optimize your code review process. Add context to PRs, find code experts for reviews, and automate the merge process to maximize developer productivity.
